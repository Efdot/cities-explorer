# Cities Explorer Launch
## Marketing & Announcement Plan

---

## THE WHY

Cities was never just about selling art. It was about capturing something true—the feeling of looking down at a place and seeing its hidden logic, its chaos, its beauty. Every city tells a story through its grid, its curves, its water, its density.

The Explorer exists because **the art deserves to be experienced**, not just collected. Because someone who will never own a City should still be able to lose themselves in the Golden Hour palette at zoom level 3. Because a collector with 11 pieces should be able to see their whole collection breathing together in one place.

This isn't a sales tool disguised as generosity. This is just... how it should be.

## CORE MESSAGING PILLARS

### 1. **Art is for looking at**
The Explorer lets anyone browse, filter, favorite, and fall in love with Cities—whether or not they ever mint one.

### 2. **Collectors deserve better tools**
If you trusted us with your ETH, the least we can do is give you a beautiful way to see what you own, discover what you missed, and connect with other collectors.

### 3. **The details matter**
318 unique cities. 24 palettes. Dawn, day, dusk, night. Water features, traffic patterns, zoom levels. We built this so you could actually *find* the city that was always meant for you.

### 4. **Community over hype**
No countdown timers. No artificial scarcity language. Just a tool that makes the art more accessible and enjoyable.

### Phase 2: Feature Walkthrough (Day 1-2)
**Channel:** Twitter/X thread, Instagram Stories/Carousel
**Tone:** Helpful, detail-oriented

**Thread structure:**

**1/7** The Cities Explorer is live. Here's what you can do with it:

**2/7** **Browse everything.** All 318 minted cities in one place. Grid view, palette view, A-Z, or sorted by rarity. Whatever way your brain works.

**3/7** **Filter by traits.** Looking for a Night city with water? A Dawn city at max zoom? A specific palette you fell in love with? Now you can actually find it.

**4/7** **Favorite without buying.** Heart the cities that speak to you. Build your dream collection even if you're just here to look. No wallet required.

**5/7** **Explore collectors.** See who's building collections, what palettes they're drawn to. The community is part of the art.

**6/7** **Immersive gallery mode.** Sometimes you just want to watch the cities scroll by. We get it.

**7/7** This took months to build. It's free. It works on mobile. Go play with it.

### Phase 3: Collector Spotlight (Day 3-5)
**Channel:** Twitter/X, Newsletter

> [2-3 images of their cities]
>

### Phase 4: The Palettes (Day 5-7)

> **Neon District**
>
> [grid of 4-6 Neon District cities]
>
> The city at night, signs buzzing, everything slightly unreal.

---

### Phase 5: Newsletter (Day 7)
**Channel:** Email
**Tone:** Personal, direct

---

**Subject lines (test):**
- A better way to look at Cities
- The Cities Explorer is live
- 318 cities, one place to see them all

---

**Body:**

Hey—

I made something I've been wanting to exist for a while.

The **Cities Explorer** is a free tool for browsing, filtering, and experiencing the entire Cities collection. It works whether you own 50 cities or zero.

**What it does:**
- Browse all 318 minted cities in grid, palette, or gallery view
- Filter by time of day, palette, zoom level, water features, traffic
- Favorite cities you love (no wallet needed)
- See collector profiles and who's building what
- Immersive gallery mode for when you just want to watch

**What it doesn't do:**
- Require you to connect a wallet
- Push you to buy anything
- Harvest your data for some other purpose

I built this because I think art should be easy to look at. Marketplaces optimize for transactions. This optimizes for enjoying the work.

If you're a collector, I hope this makes your collection feel more like *yours*. If you're not, I hope you find a city that makes you feel something.

Thanks for being here.

## INSTAGRAM STRATEGY

### Post Types:

**1. Carousel: "How to use the Explorer"**
- Slide 1: Title card with Cities branding
- Slides 2-5: Screenshots of key features with minimal text overlay
- Slide 6: Link in bio CTA

**2. Reels: Screen recording walkthrough**
- 30-45 seconds
- No voiceover, just ambient music
- Show the satisfying moments: filtering, gallery mode scrolling, palette sorting

**3. Single image posts: Palette showcases**
- Grid of 4 cities from one palette
- Caption focuses on the mood/feeling, not sales

**4. Stories: Day-of-launch**
- "It's live" announcement
- Poll: "Which palette should I explore first?"
- Swipe-up to Explorer
- Collector shoutouts

---

## FARCASTER / WARPCAST STRATEGY

More conversational, community-oriented. This audience appreciates builders showing their work.

> Finally shipped the Cities Explorer.
>
> Took way longer than expected (scope creep is real) but it's the tool I wish existed when I was browsing generative collections.
>
> You can filter by every trait, favorite without a wallet, see collector profiles, enter a gallery mode that's honestly just nice to have on in the background.
>
> Would love feedback from anyone who plays with it. What's missing? What's broken?
>
> [link]

**Follow-up posts:**
- Share interesting discoveries ("TIL there are only 3 cities with [rare trait combination]")
- Respond to feedback publicly
- Share collector collections with their permission

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ "Only X cities left!" scarcity language
❌ Price mentions in Explorer launch content
❌ "This will make Cities more valuable" framing
❌ Fake urgency of any kind
❌ Influencer-style "OMG you guys" energy
❌ Asking people to "support" by buying
❌ Making collectors feel like they need to shill

---

## METRICS THAT MATTER

**Don't obsess over:**
- Immediate sales
- Follower growth

**Do pay attention to:**
- Time spent in Explorer (are people actually using it?)
- Favorites created (are people engaging with the art?)
- Return visitors (did they come back?)
- Organic shares (did anyone find it worth sharing?)
- Collector feedback (are the people who trusted you happy?)

---

## LONG-TERM CONTENT IDEAS

1. **"City of the Week"** - Deep dive into one randomly selected city, its traits, who owns it, what makes it interesting

2. **Palette psychology** - What draws people to certain color combinations? Feature collectors and their palette preferences

3. **Collector interviews** - Short Q&As with collectors about how they choose, what they see in the work

4. **Behind the Explorer** - Dev/design process, what you learned building it, what Diid contributed

5. **Generative art appreciation** - Educational content about the medium, not specific to Cities

## SAMPLE SOCIAL POSTS

### Twitter/X - Launch day

> The Cities Explorer is live.
>
> Browse all 318 cities. Filter by palette, time, zoom, water. Favorite the ones you love. See who's collecting what.
>
> No wallet required. No sales pitch. Just a better way to experience the art.
>
> efdotstudio.com/cities (or wherever it lives)

---

### Twitter/X - Casual follow-up

> Someone asked why I spent months building a free tool for a collection that's already minted.
>
> Honestly? Because I wanted it to exist. Because the art deserves more than a marketplace thumbnail. Because collectors deserve nice things.
>
> That's it. That's the whole reason.

---

### Instagram caption - Palette post

> **La Haze**
>
> Yellow smog, pink neon, the particular amber of Los Angeles at golden hour when the pollution makes everything beautiful.
>
> 12 cities live in this palette. You can find them all in the Explorer now—link in bio.

---

### Farcaster - Builder mode

> Just added a small thing to the Cities Explorer: when you hover on "Cities" it slowly italicizes.
>
> Completely unnecessary. Took an hour to get the easing right. Worth it.
>
> Sometimes the details that don't matter are the ones that matter most.

---

## FINAL NOTES

The best marketing for this isn't marketing. It's making something so good that people want to share it.

Lead with the work. Let the Explorer speak for itself. When you do talk about it, talk like a person who made something they're proud of—not a brand trying to manufacture excitement.

The people who care about Cities already care. The Explorer just gives them a better way to care.
